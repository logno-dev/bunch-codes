If you've found this site and by extension this blog post, I am guessing I may have forced you to use something I've built and out of curiosity you went to check out the domain attached to it. Well, here you are, and there is nothing terribly exciting. Sorry about that.

If you are genuinely curious about who I am and what I do, well, my name is Logan Bunch and I am trying to be a software developer. I have entered the field relatively late, so for my age, I am not the expert in the field that I would have liked to be, but I'm working to get there. I am eager to learn, and I primarily learn by building.

This site was drummed up out of a combination of a desire to explore [Astro.build](https://astro.build) and an idea to capture the design aesthetic of 80's tech companies. I enjoy writing, but I am overly critical of myself, so I tend to hate things that I write not long after I write them. So I may put some articles down here or I may not.

Between my full time job and my family, I don't really have time to do freelance work, but if you want to reach me and do something with me email me at [logan@bunch.codes](mailto:logan@bunch.codes).

Looking forward to building some stuff and learning some stuff!
