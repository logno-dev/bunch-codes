Some test content for my test post.

Macbooks seem to be pretty popular in the space of web development, and I can see why. They have excellent battery life (particularly the M series chips), they support most software you would ever need run for web development, easy access to a Unix-type shell, and they pack a decent punch as far as performance goes. However, new Macbooks will cost a you a pretty penny and its quite honestly a bit of an overkill for web development. If you have an affinity for Apple products and you have the budget for it, go for it. Used or refurbished Macbooks are available and can be found at reasonable prices for models that are several years old, but you are still sinking quite a bit of cost into some significantly aged hardware, so do your research and buy at your own risk.


```javascript
let variable

function myFunc() {
  console.log(variable)
}
